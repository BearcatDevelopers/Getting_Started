To-Do list:

Grid: Difficulty of language (below) by difficulty by level/combination of logic. 

Simple languages: Javascript 
Intermediate: Python, Php 
Advanced: Ruby, Java

Simple concepts: if/else, loops, boolean
Intermediate: User input
Advanced: error handling
Mega-advanced: combine languages AND concepts (EX: call a ruby script to run from a python function)


Build Applications:

> Static Web Page - Dan & Marlena
  - HTML/CSS
  # We could use each type of tag in HTML to describe what each tag does
  # "About me" page
> Dynamic Web Page - Dan: use JQuery, Marlena: use JS
  - HTML/CSS 
  - JavaScript
  # Dynamic "About me" page

Incorporate into all applications: 
--------------------------------------
> Logic - Boolean (yes/no)
  # Introduce conditionals
  
> Data Types
  #list out- "this is how to declare variables in this language:"

> Data Structures
  - Variables
  - Arrays
  - Hashes (Ruby)
  
> Object-orientation
--------------------------------------  
>> If/else: 
  # Set common goal for application: Dan does if/else, Marlena does switch. 
  # Both use all 5 Languages
  - Javascript
  - Python
  - PHP
  - Ruby
  - Java


>> Loops
  # Set common goal for apps: Dan does for, Marlena does do/while
  # Both use all 5 languages
  - JS
  - Java
  - PHP
  - Python
  - Ruby

>> Functions
  # set common goal for functions: 
  - Write 'hello world' in every language from a function
