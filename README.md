# Metadata

Welcome to the Bearcat Developers!

Metadata means "data about the data" or "This is what all of the following crap does and means: "
Every program we write will have some sort of metadata, but we won't necessarily create a seperate file for it every time. 
Rule #1 of programming in an open-source environment - always read the README and metadata first!

About Us: 
Dan Billmann & Marlena Hansen - Supreme Overlords

Bearcat developers was founded with the goal of helping students gain skills and confidence to interview for and accept technical internships and entry-level positions. 

We plan on teaching students different ways to apprach business problems with technical solutions. 

We also want students new to programming to learn a new skill and will start with very basic levels of programming concepts and work our way up to more advanced levels. 

Major Caveat: You will get out exactly what you put into this. For new people, dedicating time and resilience to figuring out how everything works and fits together is the difference between good programmers and bad. 


This here is a Github repository where we will store our code and collaborate on projects. Knowing how to use Git and Github properly in the workplace is a valueable skill in many application-developing places. 

We're looking forward to a great year with you! 

Go Bearcats!
